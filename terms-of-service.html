      <li>Credits are not legal tender or currency, and they are not redeemable, refundable, or exchangeable for any sum of money or monetary value.</li>
      <li>Credits have no equivalent value in fiat currency and do not act as a substitute for fiat currency.</li>

      <li>Our Services may provide incomplete, incorrect, or offensive Output that does not represent Avocado's views. If Output references any third party products or services, it doesn't mean the third party endorses or is affiliated with Avocado.</li>
